# China will lose the US market?

A: China will lose the US market.

B: China has been here for 5,000 years. Most of the time, where was no United States and we survived.
   And if the United States want to bully China, we will deal with the situation without the United States. And we expect to 
   survive for another 5,000 years. 

A: When you hear Donald Trump say, "China wants a deal", It just doesn't know to how to go about it. They are proud people, 
   JD Vance talked about "Chinese peasants". What do you make of their conduct in this respect?

B: If JD Vance thinks that he is dealing with the peasants in China, I am proud to be a descendent of the peasants. Most of us
   are descendents of peasants. Anyway, that is our tradition. We are farmers before. But now, we are one of the leading industrialized
   economies int the world. So, I'm sorry JD Vance doesn't know what he is talking about.And , therefore, I don't think there will be
   China-US dialogue unless the United States changes its attitude towards China. Deal with China as it is. Show respect to China. 
   Show respect to the Chineses people. And don't try to impose your prejudice and biased view on China or about the rest of the world.
